# Model Card

For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details

This model is a classification algorithm developed using publicly available data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Its primary objective is to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually. The model is implemented using a Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning method known for its effectiveness in handling structured data and reducing overfitting.

## Intended Use

This model is intended to be used for exploratory data analysis, educational purposes, and prototyping income prediction systems. It can support research or demonstrations related to socioeconomic trends, machine learning interpretability, or decision-making based on demographic and economic data. The model is not intended for use in high-stakes decision-making such as credit scoring, hiring, or social services eligibility without significant further validation, fairness assessment, and domain-specific adjustments.

## Training Data

The model was trained on the Census Income dataset, publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income). The dataset is stored locally in a file named census.csv.

## Evaluation Data

The model was evaluated using a hold-out test set derived from the original Census Income dataset. The dataset was randomly split into training and test sets, with approximately 80% used for training and 20% reserved for evaluation.

## Metrics

The model was evaluated according to the following metrics:

-Precision
    -Result: 0.7446
-Recall
    -Result: 0.6404
-F1 Score
    -Result: 0.6886

## Ethical Considerations

This model is trained on historical census data, which may reflect systemic biases and social inequalities. Predictions based on demographic attributes (e.g., race, gender, education level, occupation) may inadvertently reinforce or perpetuate existing biases. Users should be aware of the ethical implications of using such models in contexts where fairness, transparency, and accountability are critical. Additionally, privacy considerations should be taken into account when handling or deploying models trained on personal data, even when that data is publicly available.

## Caveats and Recommendations

-The model's accuracy is constrained by the quality and representativeness of the census data. Changes in societal conditions or economic factors may reduce its relevance over time.
-This model does not account for causal relationshipsâ€”predicted income levels should not be interpreted as direct outcomes of individual attributes.
-Users are strongly encouraged to audit the model for bias across sensitive features and to apply fairness-aware techniques if deploying in sensitive contexts.
-Any real-world deployment should include a human-in-the-loop review process, post-deployment monitoring, and impact assessment.
